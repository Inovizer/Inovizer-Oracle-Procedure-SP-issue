10 Handling PL/SQL Errors
There is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at without result. â€”Winston Churchill

Run-time errors arise from design faults, coding mistakes, hardware failures, and many other sources. Although you cannot anticipate all possible errors, you can plan to handle certain kinds of errors meaningful to your PL/SQL program.

With many programming languages, unless you disable error checking, a run-time error such as stack overflow or division by zero stops normal processing and returns control to the operating system. With PL/SQL, a mechanism called exception handling lets you "bulletproof" your program so that it can continue operating in the presence of errors.

Overview of PL/SQL Runtime Error Handling
In PL/SQL, an error condition is called an exception. Exceptions can be internally defined (by the runtime system) or user defined. Examples of internally defined exceptions include division by zero and out of memory. Some common internal exceptions have predefined names, such as ZERO_DIVIDE and STORAGE_ERROR. The other internal exceptions can be given names.

You can define exceptions of your own in the declarative part of any PL/SQL block, subprogram, or package. For example, you might define an exception named insufficient_funds to flag overdrawn bank accounts. Unlike internal exceptions, user-defined exceptions must be given names.

When an error occurs, an exception is raised. That is, normal execution stops and control transfers to the exception-handling part of your PL/SQL block or subprogram. Internal exceptions are raised implicitly (automatically) by the run-time system. User-defined exceptions must be raised explicitly by RAISE statements, which can also raise predefined exceptions.

To handle raised exceptions, you write separate routines called exception handlers. After an exception handler runs, the current block stops executing and the enclosing block resumes with the next statement. If there is no enclosing block, control returns to the host environment.

The following example calculates a price-to-earnings ratio for a company. If the company has zero earnings, the division operation raises the predefined exception ZERO_DIVIDE, the execution of the block is interrupted, and control is transferred to the exception handlers. The optional OTHERS handler catches all exceptions that the block does not name specifically.

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;

DECLARE
   stock_price NUMBER := 9.73;
   net_earnings NUMBER := 0;
   pe_ratio NUMBER;
BEGIN
-- Calculation might cause division-by-zero error.
   pe_ratio := stock_price / net_earnings;
   dbms_output.put_line('Price/earnings ratio = ' || pe_ratio);

EXCEPTION  -- exception handlers begin

-- Only one of the WHEN blocks is executed.

   WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN  -- handles 'division by zero' error
      dbms_output.put_line('Company must have had zero earnings.');
      pe_ratio := null;

   WHEN OTHERS THEN  -- handles all other errors
      dbms_output.put_line('Some other kind of error occurred.');
      pe_ratio := null;

END;  -- exception handlers and block end here
/
The last example illustrates exception handling. With some better error checking, we could have avoided the exception entirely, by substituting a null for the answer if the denominator was zero:

DECLARE
   stock_price NUMBER := 9.73;
   net_earnings NUMBER := 0;
   pe_ratio NUMBER;
BEGIN
   pe_ratio :=
      case net_earnings
         when 0 then null
         else stock_price / net_earnings
      end;
END;
/
Guidelines for Avoiding and Handling PL/SQL Errors and Exceptions
Because reliability is crucial for database programs, use both error checking and exception handling to ensure your program can handle all possibilities:

Add exception handlers whenever there is any possibility of an error occurring. Errors are especially likely during arithmetic calculations, string manipulation, and database operations. Errors could also occur at other times, for example if a hardware failure with disk storage or memory causes a problem that has nothing to do with your code; but your code still needs to take corrective action.

Add error-checking code whenever you can predict that an error might occur if your code gets bad input data. Expect that at some time, your code will be passed incorrect or null parameters, that your queries will return no rows or more rows than you expect.

Make your programs robust enough to work even if the database is not in the state you expect. For example, perhaps a table you query will have columns added or deleted, or their types changed. You can avoid such problems by declaring individual variables with %TYPE qualifiers, and declaring records to hold query results with %ROWTYPE qualifiers.

Handle named exceptions whenever possible, instead of using WHEN OTHERS in exception handlers. Learn the names and causes of the predefined exceptions. If your database operations might cause particular ORA- errors, associate names with these errors so you can write handlers for them. (You will learn how to do that later in this chapter.)

Test your code with different combinations of bad data to see what potential errors arise.

Write out debugging information in your exception handlers. You might store such information in a separate table. If so, do it by making a call to a procedure declared with the PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION, so that you can commit your debugging information, even if you roll back the work that the main procedure was doing.

Carefully consider whether each exception handler should commit the transaction, roll it back, or let it continue. Remember, no matter how severe the error is, you want to leave the database in a consistent state and avoid storing any bad data.

Advantages of PL/SQL Exceptions
Using exceptions for error handling has several advantages.

With exceptions, you can reliably handle potential errors from many statements with a single exception handler:

BEGIN
   SELECT ...
   SELECT ...
   procedure_that_performs_select();
   ...
EXCEPTION
   WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN  -- catches all 'no data found' errors

Instead of checking for an error at every point it might occur, just add an exception handler to your PL/SQL block. If the exception is ever raised in that block (or any sub-block), you can be sure it will be handled.

Sometimes the error is not immediately obvious, and could not be detected until later when you perform calculations using bad data. Again, a single exception handler can trap all division-by-zero errors, bad array subscripts, and so on.

If you need to check for errors at a specific spot, you can enclose a single statement or a group of statements inside its own BEGIN-END block with its own exception handler. You can make the checking as general or as precise as you like.

Isolating error-handling routines makes the rest of the program easier to read and understand.

Summary of Predefined PL/SQL Exceptions
An internal exception is raised automatically if your PL/SQL program violates an Oracle rule or exceeds a system-dependent limit. PL/SQL predefines some common Oracle errors as exceptions. For example, PL/SQL raises the predefined exception NO_DATA_FOUND if a SELECT INTO statement returns no rows.

You can use the pragma EXCEPTION_INIT to associate exception names with other Oracle error codes that you can anticipate. To handle unexpected Oracle errors, you can use the OTHERS handler. Within this handler, you can call the functions SQLCODE and SQLERRM to return the Oracle error code and message text. Once you know the error code, you can use it with pragma EXCEPTION_INIT and write a handler specifically for that error.

PL/SQL declares predefined exceptions globally in package STANDARD. You need not declare them yourself. You can write handlers for predefined exceptions using the names in the following list:

Exception	Oracle Error	SQLCODE Value
ACCESS_INTO_NULL	ORA-06530	-6530
CASE_NOT_FOUND	ORA-06592	-6592
COLLECTION_IS_NULL	ORA-06531	-6531
CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN	ORA-06511	-6511
DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX	ORA-00001	-1
INVALID_CURSOR	ORA-01001	-1001
INVALID_NUMBER	ORA-01722	-1722
LOGIN_DENIED	ORA-01017	-1017
NO_DATA_FOUND	ORA-01403	+100
NOT_LOGGED_ON	ORA-01012	-1012
PROGRAM_ERROR	ORA-06501	-6501
ROWTYPE_MISMATCH	ORA-06504	-6504
SELF_IS_NULL	ORA-30625	-30625
STORAGE_ERROR	ORA-06500	-6500
SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT	ORA-06533	-6533
SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT	ORA-06532	-6532
SYS_INVALID_ROWID	ORA-01410	-1410
TIMEOUT_ON_RESOURCE	ORA-00051	-51
TOO_MANY_ROWS	ORA-01422	-1422
VALUE_ERROR	ORA-06502	-6502
ZERO_DIVIDE	ORA-01476	-1476

Brief descriptions of the predefined exceptions follow:

Exception	Raised when ...
ACCESS_INTO_NULL	A program attempts to assign values to the attributes of an uninitialized object.
CASE_NOT_FOUND	None of the choices in the WHEN clauses of a CASE statement is selected, and there is no ELSE clause.
COLLECTION_IS_NULL	A program attempts to apply collection methods other than EXISTS to an uninitialized nested table or varray, or the program attempts to assign values to the elements of an uninitialized nested table or varray.
CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN	A program attempts to open an already open cursor. A cursor must be closed before it can be reopened. A cursor FOR loop automatically opens the cursor to which it refers, so your program cannot open that cursor inside the loop.
DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX	A program attempts to store duplicate values in a database column that is constrained by a unique index.
INVALID_CURSOR	A program attempts a cursor operation that is not allowed, such as closing an unopened cursor.
INVALID_NUMBER	In a SQL statement, the conversion of a character string into a number fails because the string does not represent a valid number. (In procedural statements, VALUE_ERROR is raised.) This exception is also raised when the LIMIT-clause expression in a bulk FETCH statement does not evaluate to a positive number.
LOGIN_DENIED	A program attempts to log on to Oracle with an invalid username or password.
NO_DATA_FOUND	A SELECT INTO statement returns no rows, or your program references a deleted element in a nested table or an uninitialized element in an index-by table.
Because this exception is used internally by some SQL functions to signal that they are finished, you should not rely on this exception being propagated if you raise it within a function that is called as part of a query.

NOT_LOGGED_ON	A program issues a database call without being connected to Oracle.
PROGRAM_ERROR	PL/SQL has an internal problem.
ROWTYPE_MISMATCH	The host cursor variable and PL/SQL cursor variable involved in an assignment have incompatible return types. For example, when an open host cursor variable is passed to a stored subprogram, the return types of the actual and formal parameters must be compatible.
SELF_IS_NULL	A program attempts to call a MEMBER method, but the instance of the object type has not been initialized. The built-in parameter SELF points to the object, and is always the first parameter passed to a MEMBER method.
STORAGE_ERROR	PL/SQL runs out of memory or memory has been corrupted.
SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT	A program references a nested table or varray element using an index number larger than the number of elements in the collection.
SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT	A program references a nested table or varray element using an index number (-1 for example) that is outside the legal range.
SYS_INVALID_ROWID	The conversion of a character string into a universal rowid fails because the character string does not represent a valid rowid.
TIMEOUT_ON_RESOURCE	A time-out occurs while Oracle is waiting for a resource.
TOO_MANY_ROWS	A SELECT INTO statement returns more than one row.
VALUE_ERROR	An arithmetic, conversion, truncation, or size-constraint error occurs. For example, when your program selects a column value into a character variable, if the value is longer than the declared length of the variable, PL/SQL aborts the assignment and raises VALUE_ERROR. In procedural statements, VALUE_ERROR is raised if the conversion of a character string into a number fails. (In SQL statements, INVALID_NUMBER is raised.)
ZERO_DIVIDE	A program attempts to divide a number by zero.

Defining Your Own PL/SQL Exceptions
PL/SQL lets you define exceptions of your own. Unlike predefined exceptions, user-defined exceptions must be declared and must be raised explicitly by RAISE statements.

Declaring PL/SQL Exceptions
Exceptions can be declared only in the declarative part of a PL/SQL block, subprogram, or package. You declare an exception by introducing its name, followed by the keyword EXCEPTION. In the following example, you declare an exception named past_due:

DECLARE
   past_due EXCEPTION;

Exception and variable declarations are similar. But remember, an exception is an error condition, not a data item. Unlike variables, exceptions cannot appear in assignment statements or SQL statements. However, the same scope rules apply to variables and exceptions.

Scope Rules for PL/SQL Exceptions
You cannot declare an exception twice in the same block. You can, however, declare the same exception in two different blocks.

Exceptions declared in a block are considered local to that block and global to all its sub-blocks. Because a block can reference only local or global exceptions, enclosing blocks cannot reference exceptions declared in a sub-block.

If you redeclare a global exception in a sub-block, the local declaration prevails. The sub-block cannot reference the global exception, unless the exception is declared in a labeled block and you qualify its name with the block label:

block_label.exception_name

The following example illustrates the scope rules:

DECLARE
   past_due EXCEPTION;
   acct_num NUMBER;
BEGIN
   DECLARE  ---------- sub-block begins
      past_due EXCEPTION;  -- this declaration prevails
      acct_num NUMBER;
     due_date DATE := SYSDATE - 1;
     todays_date DATE := SYSDATE;
   BEGIN
      IF due_date < todays_date THEN
         RAISE past_due;  -- this is not handled
      END IF;
   END;  ------------- sub-block ends
EXCEPTION
   WHEN past_due THEN  -- does not handle RAISEd exception
      dbms_output.put_line('Handling PAST_DUE exception.');
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
     dbms_output.put_line('Could not recognize PAST_DUE_EXCEPTION in this scope.');
END;
/
The enclosing block does not handle the raised exception because the declaration of past_due in the sub-block prevails. Though they share the same name, the two past_due exceptions are different, just as the two acct_num variables share the same name but are different variables. Thus, the RAISE statement and the WHEN clause refer to different exceptions. To have the enclosing block handle the raised exception, you must remove its declaration from the sub-block or define an OTHERS handler.

Associating a PL/SQL Exception with a Number: Pragma EXCEPTION_INIT
To handle error conditions (typically ORA- messages) that have no predefined name, you must use the OTHERS handler or the pragma EXCEPTION_INIT. A pragma is a compiler directive that is processed at compile time, not at run time.

In PL/SQL, the pragma EXCEPTION_INIT tells the compiler to associate an exception name with an Oracle error number. That lets you refer to any internal exception by name and to write a specific handler for it. When you see an error stack, or sequence of error messages, the one on top is the one that you can trap and handle.

You code the pragma EXCEPTION_INIT in the declarative part of a PL/SQL block, subprogram, or package using the syntax

PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(exception_name, -Oracle_error_number);

where exception_name is the name of a previously declared exception and the number is a negative value corresponding to an ORA- error number. The pragma must appear somewhere after the exception declaration in the same declarative section, as shown in the following example:

DECLARE
   deadlock_detected EXCEPTION;
   PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(deadlock_detected, -60);
BEGIN
   null; -- Some operation that causes an ORA-00060 error
EXCEPTION
   WHEN deadlock_detected THEN
      null; -- handle the error
END;
/
Defining Your Own Error Messages: Procedure RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR
The procedure RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR lets you issue user-defined ORA- error messages from stored subprograms. That way, you can report errors to your application and avoid returning unhandled exceptions.

To call RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR, use the syntax

raise_application_error(error_number, message[, {TRUE | FALSE}]);

where error_number is a negative integer in the range -20000 .. -20999 and message is a character string up to 2048 bytes long. If the optional third parameter is TRUE, the error is placed on the stack of previous errors. If the parameter is FALSE (the default), the error replaces all previous errors. RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR is part of package DBMS_STANDARD, and as with package STANDARD, you do not need to qualify references to it.

An application can call raise_application_error only from an executing stored subprogram (or method). When called, raise_application_error ends the subprogram and returns a user-defined error number and message to the application. The error number and message can be trapped like any Oracle error.

In the following example, you call raise_application_error if an error condition of your choosing happens (in this case, if the current schema owns less than 1000 tables):

DECLARE
   num_tables NUMBER;
BEGIN
   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO num_tables FROM USER_TABLES;
   IF num_tables < 1000 THEN
      /* Issue your own error code (ORA-20101) with your own error message. */
      raise_application_error(-20101, 'Expecting at least 1000 tables');
   ELSE
      NULL; -- Do the rest of the processing (for the non-error case).
   END IF;
END;
/
The calling application gets a PL/SQL exception, which it can process using the error-reporting functions SQLCODE and SQLERRM in an OTHERS handler. Also, it can use the pragma EXCEPTION_INIT to map specific error numbers returned by raise_application_error to exceptions of its own, as the following Pro*C example shows:

EXEC SQL EXECUTE
   /* Execute embedded PL/SQL block using host 
      variables my_emp_id and my_amount, which were
      assigned values in the host environment. */
   DECLARE
      null_salary EXCEPTION;
      /* Map error number returned by raise_application_error
         to user-defined exception. */
      PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(null_salary, -20101);
   BEGIN
      raise_salary(:my_emp_id, :my_amount);
   EXCEPTION
      WHEN null_salary THEN
         INSERT INTO emp_audit VALUES (:my_emp_id, ...);
   END;
END-EXEC;

This technique allows the calling application to handle error conditions in specific exception handlers.

Redeclaring Predefined Exceptions
Remember, PL/SQL declares predefined exceptions globally in package STANDARD, so you need not declare them yourself. Redeclaring predefined exceptions is error prone because your local declaration overrides the global declaration. For example, if you declare an exception named invalid_number and then PL/SQL raises the predefined exception INVALID_NUMBER internally, a handler written for INVALID_NUMBER will not catch the internal exception. In such cases, you must use dot notation to specify the predefined exception, as follows:

EXCEPTION
   WHEN invalid_number OR STANDARD.INVALID_NUMBER THEN 
      -- handle the error
END;
How PL/SQL Exceptions Are Raised
Internal exceptions are raised implicitly by the run-time system, as are user-defined exceptions that you have associated with an Oracle error number using EXCEPTION_INIT. However, other user-defined exceptions must be raised explicitly by RAISE statements.

Raising Exceptions with the RAISE Statement
PL/SQL blocks and subprograms should raise an exception only when an error makes it undesirable or impossible to finish processing. You can place RAISE statements for a given exception anywhere within the scope of that exception. In the following example, you alert your PL/SQL block to a user-defined exception named out_of_stock:

DECLARE
   out_of_stock   EXCEPTION;
   number_on_hand NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
   IF number_on_hand < 1 THEN
      RAISE out_of_stock; -- raise an exception that we defined
   END IF;
EXCEPTION
   WHEN out_of_stock THEN
      -- handle the error
      dbms_output.put_line('Encountered out-of-stock error.');
END;
/
You can also raise a predefined exception explicitly. That way, an exception handler written for the predefined exception can process other errors, as the following example shows:

DECLARE
   acct_type INTEGER := 7;
BEGIN
   IF acct_type NOT IN (1, 2, 3) THEN
      RAISE INVALID_NUMBER;  -- raise predefined exception
   END IF;
EXCEPTION
   WHEN INVALID_NUMBER THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Handling invalid input by rolling back.');
      ROLLBACK;
END;
/
How PL/SQL Exceptions Propagate
When an exception is raised, if PL/SQL cannot find a handler for it in the current block or subprogram, the exception propagates. That is, the exception reproduces itself in successive enclosing blocks until a handler is found or there are no more blocks to search. If no handler is found, PL/SQL returns an unhandled exception error to the host environment.

Exceptions cannot propagate across remote procedure calls done through database links. A PL/SQL block cannot catch an exception raised by a remote subprogram. For a workaround, see "Defining Your Own Error Messages: Procedure RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR".

Figure 10-1, Figure 10-2, and Figure 10-3 illustrate the basic propagation rules.

Description of lnpls010.gif follows

Figure 10-3 Propagation Rules: Example 3

Description of lnpls011.gif follows
Description of the illustration lnpls011.gif

An exception can propagate beyond its scope, that is, beyond the block in which it was declared. Consider the following example:

BEGIN
   DECLARE  ---------- sub-block begins
     past_due EXCEPTION;
     due_date DATE := trunc(SYSDATE) - 1;
     todays_date DATE := trunc(SYSDATE);
   BEGIN
     IF due_date < todays_date THEN
        RAISE past_due;
     END IF;
   END;  ------------- sub-block ends
EXCEPTION
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
      ROLLBACK;
END;
/
Because the block that declares the exception past_due has no handler for it, the exception propagates to the enclosing block. But the enclosing block cannot reference the name PAST_DUE, because the scope where it was declared no longer exists. Once the exception name is lost, only an OTHERS handler can catch the exception. If there is no handler for a user-defined exception, the calling application gets this error:

ORA-06510: PL/SQL: unhandled user-defined exception
Reraising a PL/SQL Exception
Sometimes, you want to reraise an exception, that is, handle it locally, then pass it to an enclosing block. For example, you might want to roll back a transaction in the current block, then log the error in an enclosing block.

To reraise an exception, use a RAISE statement without an exception name, which is allowed only in an exception handler:

DECLARE
   salary_too_high  EXCEPTION;
   current_salary NUMBER := 20000;
   max_salary NUMBER := 10000;
   erroneous_salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
   BEGIN  ---------- sub-block begins
      IF current_salary > max_salary THEN
         RAISE salary_too_high;  -- raise the exception
      END IF;
   EXCEPTION
      WHEN salary_too_high THEN
         -- first step in handling the error
        dbms_output.put_line('Salary ' || erroneous_salary ||
          ' is out of range.');
        dbms_output.put_line('Maximum salary is ' || max_salary || '.');
         RAISE;  -- reraise the current exception
   END;  ------------ sub-block ends
EXCEPTION
   WHEN salary_too_high THEN
      -- handle the error more thoroughly
      erroneous_salary := current_salary;
      current_salary := max_salary;
     dbms_output.put_line('Revising salary from ' || erroneous_salary ||
       'to ' || current_salary || '.');
END;
/
Handling Raised PL/SQL Exceptions
When an exception is raised, normal execution of your PL/SQL block or subprogram stops and control transfers to its exception-handling part, which is formatted as follows:

EXCEPTION
   WHEN exception_name1 THEN  -- handler
      sequence_of_statements1
   WHEN exception_name2 THEN  -- another handler
      sequence_of_statements2
   ...
   WHEN OTHERS THEN           -- optional handler
      sequence_of_statements3
END;

To catch raised exceptions, you write exception handlers. Each handler consists of a WHEN clause, which specifies an exception, followed by a sequence of statements to be executed when that exception is raised. These statements complete execution of the block or subprogram; control does not return to where the exception was raised. In other words, you cannot resume processing where you left off.

The optional OTHERS exception handler, which is always the last handler in a block or subprogram, acts as the handler for all exceptions not named specifically. Thus, a block or subprogram can have only one OTHERS handler.

As the following example shows, use of the OTHERS handler guarantees that no exception will go unhandled:

EXCEPTION
   WHEN ... THEN
      -- handle the error
   WHEN ... THEN
      -- handle the error
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
      -- handle all other errors
END;

If you want two or more exceptions to execute the same sequence of statements, list the exception names in the WHEN clause, separating them by the keyword OR, as follows:

EXCEPTION
   WHEN over_limit OR under_limit OR VALUE_ERROR THEN
      -- handle the error

If any of the exceptions in the list is raised, the associated sequence of statements is executed. The keyword OTHERS cannot appear in the list of exception names; it must appear by itself. You can have any number of exception handlers, and each handler can associate a list of exceptions with a sequence of statements. However, an exception name can appear only once in the exception-handling part of a PL/SQL block or subprogram.

The usual scoping rules for PL/SQL variables apply, so you can reference local and global variables in an exception handler. However, when an exception is raised inside a cursor FOR loop, the cursor is closed implicitly before the handler is invoked. Therefore, the values of explicit cursor attributes are not available in the handler.

Handling Exceptions Raised in Declarations
Exceptions can be raised in declarations by faulty initialization expressions. For example, the following declaration raises an exception because the constant credit_limit cannot store numbers larger than 999:

DECLARE
   credit_limit CONSTANT NUMBER(3) := 5000;  -- raises an exception
BEGIN
   NULL;
EXCEPTION
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
      -- Cannot catch the exception. This handler is never called.
      dbms_output.put_line('Can''t handle an exception in a declaration.');
END;
/
Handlers in the current block cannot catch the raised exception because an exception raised in a declaration propagates immediately to the enclosing block.

Handling Exceptions Raised in Handlers
When an exception occurs within an exception handler, that same handler cannot catch the exception. An exception raised inside a handler propagates immediately to the enclosing block, which is searched to find a handler for this new exception. From there on, the exception propagates normally. For example:

EXCEPTION
   WHEN INVALID_NUMBER THEN
      INSERT INTO ...  -- might raise DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX
   WHEN DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX THEN ...  -- cannot catch the exception
END;
Branching to or from an Exception Handler
A GOTO statement can branch from an exception handler into an enclosing block.

A GOTO statement cannot branch into an exception handler, or from an exception handler into the current block.

Retrieving the Error Code and Error Message: SQLCODE and SQLERRM
In an exception handler, you can use the built-in functions SQLCODE and SQLERRM to find out which error occurred and to get the associated error message. For internal exceptions, SQLCODE returns the number of the Oracle error. The number that SQLCODE returns is negative unless the Oracle error is no data found, in which case SQLCODE returns +100. SQLERRM returns the corresponding error message. The message begins with the Oracle error code.

For user-defined exceptions, SQLCODE returns +1 and SQLERRM returns the message: User-Defined Exception.

unless you used the pragma EXCEPTION_INIT to associate the exception name with an Oracle error number, in which case SQLCODE returns that error number and SQLERRM returns the corresponding error message. The maximum length of an Oracle error message is 512 characters including the error code, nested messages, and message inserts such as table and column names.

If no exception has been raised, SQLCODE returns zero and SQLERRM returns the message: ORA-0000: normal, successful completion.

You can pass an error number to SQLERRM, in which case SQLERRM returns the message associated with that error number. Make sure you pass negative error numbers to SQLERRM.

Passing a positive number to SQLERRM always returns the message user-defined exception unless you pass +100, in which case SQLERRM returns the message no data found. Passing a zero to SQLERRM always returns the message normal, successful completion.

You cannot use SQLCODE or SQLERRM directly in a SQL statement. Instead, you must assign their values to local variables, then use the variables in the SQL statement, as shown in the following example:

DECLARE
   err_msg VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
   /* Get a few Oracle error messages. */
   FOR err_num IN 1..3 LOOP
     err_msg := SUBSTR(SQLERRM(-err_num),1,100);
     dbms_output.put_line('Error number = ' || err_num);
     dbms_output.put_line('Error message = ' || err_msg);
   END LOOP;
END;

The string function SUBSTR ensures that a VALUE_ERROR exception (for truncation) is not raised when you assign the value of SQLERRM to err_msg. The functions SQLCODE and SQLERRM are especially useful in the OTHERS exception handler because they tell you which internal exception was raised.

Note: When using pragma RESTRICT_REFERENCES to assert the purity of a stored function, you cannot specify the constraints WNPS and RNPS if the function calls SQLCODE or SQLERRM.

Catching Unhandled Exceptions
Remember, if it cannot find a handler for a raised exception, PL/SQL returns an unhandled exception error to the host environment, which determines the outcome. For example, in the Oracle Precompilers environment, any database changes made by a failed SQL statement or PL/SQL block are rolled back.

Unhandled exceptions can also affect subprograms. If you exit a subprogram successfully, PL/SQL assigns values to OUT parameters. However, if you exit with an unhandled exception, PL/SQL does not assign values to OUT parameters (unless they are NOCOPY parameters). Also, if a stored subprogram fails with an unhandled exception, PL/SQL does not roll back database work done by the subprogram.

You can avoid unhandled exceptions by coding an OTHERS handler at the topmost level of every PL/SQL program.

Tips for Handling PL/SQL Errors
In this section, you learn three techniques that increase flexibility.

Continuing after an Exception Is Raised
An exception handler lets you recover from an otherwise fatal error before exiting a block. But when the handler completes, the block is terminated. You cannot return to the current block from an exception handler. In the following example, if the SELECT INTO statement raises ZERO_DIVIDE, you cannot resume with the INSERT statement:

DECLARE
   pe_ratio NUMBER(3,1);
BEGIN
   DELETE FROM stats WHERE symbol = 'XYZ';
   SELECT price / NVL(earnings, 0) INTO pe_ratio FROM stocks
      WHERE symbol = 'XYZ';
   INSERT INTO stats (symbol, ratio) VALUES ('XYZ', pe_ratio);
EXCEPTION
   WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN
      NULL;
END;
/
You can still handle an exception for a statement, then continue with the next statement. Place the statement in its own sub-block with its own exception handlers. If an error occurs in the sub-block, a local handler can catch the exception. When the sub-block ends, the enclosing block continues to execute at the point where the sub-block ends. Consider the following example:

DECLARE
   pe_ratio NUMBER(3,1);
BEGIN
   DELETE FROM stats WHERE symbol = 'XYZ';
   BEGIN  ---------- sub-block begins
      SELECT price / NVL(earnings, 0) INTO pe_ratio FROM stocks
         WHERE symbol = 'XYZ';
   EXCEPTION
      WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN
         pe_ratio := 0;
   END;  ---------- sub-block ends
   INSERT INTO stats (symbol, ratio) VALUES ('XYZ', pe_ratio);
EXCEPTION
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
      NULL;
END;
/
In this example, if the SELECT INTO statement raises a ZERO_DIVIDE exception, the local handler catches it and sets pe_ratio to zero. Execution of the handler is complete, so the sub-block terminates, and execution continues with the INSERT statement.

You can also perform a sequence of DML operations where some might fail, and process the exceptions only after the entire operation is complete, as described in "Handling FORALL Exceptions with the %BULK_EXCEPTIONS Attribute".

Retrying a Transaction
After an exception is raised, rather than abandon your transaction, you might want to retry it. The technique is:

Encase the transaction in a sub-block.

Place the sub-block inside a loop that repeats the transaction.

Before starting the transaction, mark a savepoint. If the transaction succeeds, commit, then exit from the loop. If the transaction fails, control transfers to the exception handler, where you roll back to the savepoint undoing any changes, then try to fix the problem.

In the following example, the INSERT statement might raise an exception because of a duplicate value in a unique column. In that case, we change the value that needs to be unique and continue with the next loop iteration. If the INSERT succeeds, we exit from the loop immediately. With this technique, you should use a FOR or WHILE loop to limit the number of attempts.

DECLARE
   name   VARCHAR2(20);
   ans1   VARCHAR2(3);
   ans2   VARCHAR2(3);
   ans3   VARCHAR2(3);
   suffix NUMBER := 1;
BEGIN
   FOR i IN 1..10 LOOP  -- try 10 times
      BEGIN  -- sub-block begins
         SAVEPOINT start_transaction;  -- mark a savepoint
         /* Remove rows from a table of survey results. */
         DELETE FROM results WHERE answer1 = 'NO';
         /* Add a survey respondent's name and answers. */
         INSERT INTO results VALUES (name, ans1, ans2, ans3);
 -- raises DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX if two respondents have the same name
         COMMIT;
         EXIT;
      EXCEPTION
         WHEN DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX THEN
            ROLLBACK TO start_transaction;  -- undo changes
            suffix := suffix + 1;           -- try to fix problem
            name := name || TO_CHAR(suffix);
      END;  -- sub-block ends
   END LOOP;
END;
/
Using Locator Variables to Identify Exception Locations
Using one exception handler for a sequence of statements, such as INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statements, can mask the statement that caused an error. If you need to know which statement failed, you can use a locator variable:

DECLARE
   stmt INTEGER;
   name VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
   stmt := 1;  -- designates 1st SELECT statement
   SELECT table_name INTO name FROM user_tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'ABC%';
   stmt := 2;  -- designates 2nd SELECT statement
   SELECT table_name INTO name FROM user_tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'XYZ%';
EXCEPTION
   WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Table name not found in query ' || stmt);
END;
/
Overview of PL/SQL Compile-Time Warnings
To make your programs more robust and avoid problems at run time, you can turn on checking for certain warning conditions. These conditions are not serious enough to produce an error and keep you from compiling a subprogram. They might point out something in the subprogram that produces an undefined result or might create a performance problem.

To work with PL/SQL warning messages, you use the PLSQL_WARNINGS initialization parameter, the DBMS_WARNING package, and the USER/DBA/ALL_PLSQL_OBJECT_SETTINGS views.

PL/SQL Warning Categories
PL/SQL warning messages are divided into categories, so that you can suppress or display groups of similar warnings during compilation. The categories are:

Severe: Messages for conditions that might cause unexpected behavior or wrong results, such as aliasing problems with parameters.

Performance: Messages for conditions that might cause performance problems, such as passing a VARCHAR2 value to a NUMBER column in an INSERT statement.

Informational: Messages for conditions that do not have an effect on performance or correctness, but that you might want to change to make the code more maintainable, such as dead code that can never be executed.

The keyword All is a shorthand way to refer to all warning messages.

You can also treat particular messages as errors instead of warnings. For example, if you know that the warning message PLW-05003 represents a serious problem in your code, including 'ERROR:05003' in the PLSQL_WARNINGS setting makes that condition trigger an error message (PLS_05003) instead of a warning message. An error message causes the compilation to fail.

Controlling PL/SQL Warning Messages
To let the database issue warning messages during PL/SQL compilation, you set the initialization parameter PLSQL_WARNINGS. You can enable and disable entire categories of warnings (ALL, SEVERE, INFORMATIONAL, PERFORMANCE), enable and disable specific message numbers, and make the database treat certain warnings as compilation errors so that those conditions must be corrected.

This parameter can be set at the system level or the session level. You can also set it for a single compilation by including it as part of the ALTER PROCEDURE statement. You might turn on all warnings during development, turn off all warnings when deploying for production, or turn on some warnings when working on a particular subprogram where you are concerned with some aspect, such as unnecessary code or performance.

ALTER SYSTEM SET PLSQL_WARNINGS='ENABLE:ALL'; -- For debugging during development.
ALTER SESSION SET PLSQL_WARNINGS='ENABLE:PERFORMANCE'; -- To focus on one aspect.
ALTER PROCEDURE hello COMPILE PLSQL_WARNINGS='ENABLE:PERFORMANCE'; -- Recompile with extra checking.
ALTER SESSION SET PLSQL_WARNINGS='DISABLE:ALL'; -- To turn off all warnings.
-- We want to hear about 'severe' warnings, don't want to hear about 'performance'
-- warnings, and want PLW-06002 warnings to produce errors that halt compilation.
ALTER SESSION SET PLSQL_WARNINGS='ENABLE:SEVERE','DISABLE:PERFORMANCE','ERROR:06002';

Warning messages can be issued during compilation of PL/SQL subprograms; anonymous blocks do not produce any warnings.

The settings for the PLSQL_WARNINGS parameter are stored along with each compiled subprogram. If you recompile the subprogram with a CREATE OR REPLACE statement, the current settings for that session are used. If you recompile the subprogram with an ALTER ... COMPILE statement, the current session setting might be used, or the original setting that was stored with the subprogram, depending on whether you include the REUSE SETTINGS clause in the statement.

To see any warnings generated during compilation, you use the SQL*Plus SHOW ERRORS command or query the USER_ERRORS data dictionary view. PL/SQL warning messages all use the prefix PLW.

Using the DBMS_WARNING Package
If you are writing a development environment that compiles PL/SQL subprograms, you can control PL/SQL warning messages by calling subprograms in the DBMS_WARNING package. You might also use this package when compiling a complex application, made up of several nested SQL*Plus scripts, where different warning settings apply to different subprograms. You can save the current state of the PLSQL_WARNINGS parameter with one call to the package, change the parameter to compile a particular set of subprograms, then restore the original parameter value.

For example, here is a procedure with unnecessary code that could be removed. It could represent a mistake, or it could be intentionally hidden by a debug flag, so you might or might not want a warning message for it.

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE dead_code
AS
  x number := 10;
BEGIN
  if x = 10 then
      x := 20;
  else
    x := 100; -- dead code (never reached)
  end if;
END dead_code;/
-- By default, the preceding procedure compiles with no errors or warnings.

-- Now enable all warning messages, just for this session.
CALL DBMS_WARNING.SET_WARNING_SETTING_STRING('ENABLE:ALL' ,'SESSION');

-- Check the current warning setting.
select dbms_warning.get_warning_setting_string() from dual;

-- When we recompile the procedure, we will see a warning about the dead code.
ALTER PROCEDURE dead_code COMPILE;
